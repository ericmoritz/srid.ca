# GNOME delights

I use the GNOME desktop environment because it a delightful simple interface.

Some of my favourite aspects of GNOME include:

- **4-finger swipe**: quick switch to a second workspace with VScode open with my notes in full-screen.

- **Retina display**: GNOME gets 5k retina resolution 27" display right; it just works.
