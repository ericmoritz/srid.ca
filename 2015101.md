title: Politeness as a tool for malice
---

Politeness in a civilized society exists to make interactions among people as smooth as possible. However, more than a few groups of people have taken up the notion of politeness as a mask for projecting their malicious feelings (notably feelings of offense) onto others.

## Incident: John de Goes

I originally learned of this pattern when coming across the whole Typelevel incident against the programmer John de Goes. In summary: Typelevel accused John of being rude because of his comments on Github, and yet the people (including myself) who looked over those comments [found no problematic behaviour](https://old.reddit.com/r/scala/comments/d0uqp9/jon_pretty_condemns_deplatforming_attempt_against/ezg1pv5/).

Typelevel has, essentially, kicked John using politeness as a tool.

## Incident: NoRedInk

Another incident of similar theme was reported by a former employee of the company NoRedInk [wrote this comment](https://lukeplant.me.uk/blog/posts/why-im-leaving-elm/#comment-4868497335):

> If only I could have read this years ago, before I had the misfortune of working at NoRedInk. The team shows a bewildering mix of cargo-cult inclusiveness coupled with inability to consider that anyone could be different from them in any way that matters. I've never before or since met a group where a mentor would advise someone to "show more curiosity" by asking fewer questions!

> \[I was\] fired halfway through the period for "engaging in conflict" which I can only speculate referred to a bizarre conversation on company Slack about whether or not it made sense to add a cache.
