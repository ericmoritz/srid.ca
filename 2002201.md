# From Dhall to TOML to Free Monad 

Lately I wanted to add a "link blog" (I named it [tidbits](/tidbits/)) to [this](https://github.com/srid/website) statically generated personal website. Unlike regular pages, each with a corresponding Markdown file on disk, link items are best represented in **structured data** of some form. Traditionally we used *XML*, but being a Haskeller I wanted to use this as an excuse to explore *Dhall*.

## Dhall

See [PR that added Dhall support](https://github.com/srid/website/pull/6)

A single link entry (called "tidbit") looked like this Dhall:

```default
[ { date =
      "2019/12/31"
  , url =
      "https://qz.com/1279371/"
  , title =
      "This physicist’s ideas of time will blow your mind"
  , note =
      ''
      Introduces us to the theoretical physicist Carol Rovelli's
      book *The Order of Time*, wherein he essentially argues for
      time being an illusion.
      ''
  }
]
: List ./Tidbit.dhall
```

Repeat that ad-nausean for every link to be added. The **main problem with Dhall is ergonomics**. I found myself to be no fan of meticulously writing syntax when all I want to do is add a link to my site. The other pain point was having to keep the Haskell type definition in sync with the Dhall type, however as of this writing Dhall *very* recently gained the ability to [generate Haskell types](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1620) from Dhall types.

## TOML

See [PR that switched from Dhall to tomland](https://github.com/srid/website/pull/8)

Wanting better ergonomics I stumbled across TOML, via the [tomland](https://github.com/kowainik/tomland) library.

`tomland` does **bidirection serialization**, which allows me to _generate_ the TOML syntax from a Haskell value. This was attractive to me, because then I can just write a subcommand to append a new link (auto-fetching title, prompting other properties) to the `tidbits.toml` file, which looks like this:

```default
[[tidbit]]
date = 2019-12-31
title = "This physicist’s ideas of time will blow your mind"
url = "https://qz.com/1279371"
tags = ["Humanity"]
note = """
An article about the theoretical physicist Carol Rovelli's book *The Order
of Time*, wherein he essentially argues for time being an illusion. What I
found most remarkable about his explanation is the seeing of *identity*
itself as a product of perception of time.
"""
```

I find this to be a little more easier to work with than Dhall.

## Free Monad

I am satisfied with TOML for describing structured data like links. In another static site of mine, which tracks data for [quantified self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_self) (in particular: skin health and foods consumed, tracked every day), however, I soon hit the **limitation** of having to use a serialization library. I wanted the **flexibility** of Haskell types, without having to wrestle with tomland's encoding/ decoding layers. Since [rib](https://github.com/srid/rib) (the software used to generated this static site) already uses `ghcid`, I figured - why not just keep the data in Haskell source?

The first implementation turned out to be too ugly to bother to maintain for foreseable future:

```haskell
entries :: [(Day, Entry)]
entries =
  mconcat
    [ first (fromGregorian 2020 1)
        <$> [ neutralN
                4
                "Ate one meal at 8pm today."
                $ commonF 3 <> [costcoStrip, costcoSalmonW],
              neutral
                5
                $ commonF 3 <> [ffWagyu, costcoShrimpW]
            ]
    ]
  where
    neutral day fs = neutral' day Nothing fs
    neutralN day s fs = neutral' day (Just $ Markdown s) fs
    neutral' day s fs = (day, Entry Neutral fs s)
    commonF c = [Coffee c, fwTallow, pepper]
```

Ideally, I just want to give high-level "commands" when defining each entry, like "*Set note for today to this:* ..." and "*Record that I consumed this food*". Moreover I also wanted to "compose" these commands, and invoke them normally. Evaluating all these commands should ultimately result in the creation of the "Entry" Haskell record.

I was reminded of [free monad](http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/06/you-could-have-invented-free-monads.html) being used for DSL, so why not use this as an excuse to learn to use it?

As a result, I arrived at a much more ergonic way to define my data:

```haskell
entries :: [(Day, Entry)]
entries =
  [ onDay 2020 1 4 Neutral $ do
      coffee 3
      nyStrip
      addFood costcoSalmonW
      setNote "Ate one meal at 8pm today.",
    onDay 2020 1 5 Neutral $ do
      coffee 3
      cheapSurfNTurf
      nyStrip
      setNote "Going forward, sticking to **2 regular sized meals**.",
    onDay 2020 1 6 Good $ do
      coffee 3
      cheapSurfNTurf
      nyStrip,
    onDay 2020 1 7 Good $ do
      coffee 4
      cheapSurfNTurf
      nyStrip
      setNote "2nd cup at Caprices d'Alice, then one more at home."
  ]
  where
    onDay y m d s e = (fromGregorian y m d, runEntry $ setSkin s >> e)
    -- Food combinators
    coffee = addFood . Coffee
    -- | GB + shrimps (with pepper only), cooked in tallow.
    cheapSurfNTurf = do
      addFood fwTallow
      addFood pepper
      addFood cumin
      addFood ffWagyu  -- Wagyu ground beef
      addFood costcoShrimpW
    -- | Costco NY strips cooked with pepper in tallow
    nyStrip = do
      addFood fwTallow
      addFood pepper
      addFood costcoStrip
```

Looks much better, and I can compose commands to create new ones (here, `cheapSurfNTurf` and `nyStrip`).

The free monad type is here:

```haskell
data EntryProgramF a
  = SetNote Text a
  | Skin Mood a
  | AddFood F a
  deriving (Functor)

type EntryProgram = Free EntryProgramF
```

### Using Free Monads to incrementally construct a (barbie) record

The end goal of this DSL is to build a simple Haskell record. As such, the record must represent "partially filled" states. To that end, I used the [barbies](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/barbies) library, specifically its [strippable HKDs](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/barbies-1.1.3.0/docs/Data-Barbie-Bare.html) feature.

The definition of the record is:

```haskell
-- Not shown here is the `F` ADT which delineates into 
-- a bunch of other ADTs (mainly to distinguish between
-- food groups and their sources)
declareBareB
  [d|
    data Entry'
      = Entry'
          { skin :: Mood,
            food :: Set F,
            note :: Maybe Markdown
          }
    |]
```

Finally the free monad interpreter uses `State` to incrementally build this record, based on the commands issued. Something like this:


```haskell
interpretEntry 
  :: EntryProgramF a -> State (Entry' Covered Maybe) a
interpretEntry = \case
  SetNote s x -> do
    modify $ \e -> e {note = Just (Just (Markdown s))}
    pure x
  Skin mood x -> do
    modify $ \e -> e {skin = Just mood}
    pure x
  AddFood fx x -> do
    modify $ \e -> e 
      { food = Just $ 
          maybe (Set.singleton fx) (Set.insert fx) (food e)
      }
    pure x
```


## Better alternatives?

What do you think, dear reader? Are their [simpler ways](https://www.willamette.edu/~fruehr/haskell/evolution.html) to achieve the same goal of ergonomics and flexibility?
