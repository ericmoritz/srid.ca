# X1 Carbon Gen 7 + NixOS

I recently purchased a Thinkpad X1 Carbon (Gen 7, with 10th gen processor)[^tw1] and installed NixOS on it.

## Setting up Linux

I used [these instructions](https://github.com/andywhite37/nixos/blob/master/DUAL_BOOT_WINDOWS_GUIDE.md)[^nat] to install NixOS alongside Windows.

[^nat]: Note that you can use native Windows disk manage to resize the partition. No need to install a third party app as this article indicates.

Note the following:

- Disable Secure Boot in BIOS. NixOS won't boot otherwise.
- Use nixos-unstable and choose the latest kernel (`linuxPackages_latest`)

As usual, refer [the Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Lenovo_ThinkPad_X1_Carbon_(Gen_7)) for details.

See my [configuration.nix](https://github.com/srid/nix-config/blob/master/nixos-configuration/x1c7.nix) for full NixOS config.

## What works

- 4k resolution
  - GNOME selects 200% scaling, which is perfect for the Carbon
- Audio
- Microphone (and Yeti microphone)
- Thunderbolt, with 5k resolution in LG Ultrafine 5k monitor
  - requires 5.9 kernel (`linuxPackages_testing` on NixOS), or [this patch][edd]
- Fingerprint reader
  - Works in both login screen & command-line sudo
- Suspend
- Web camera
- Trackpad
  - Nearly as good as that of a Macbook

### Works, but not very well

- Audio via thunderbolt 3 can be choppy
- Netflix video is choppy on 5k resolution (4k is fine)

## Does not work

n/a

## Software issues

- **Google Chrome**: trackpad gestures don't work
- [**Redshift**](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Redshift) will not work on Wayland.
